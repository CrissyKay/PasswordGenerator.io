I uploaded what I have and was unable to get it to work however I wanted to submit on time. I double checked my code and I am at a loss what isnt executing correctly. I did not commit multiple because I worked on it in one pass as I am a single mom and didnt have any other time to do this project.

Hopefully you can tell me what I did wrong. 

Thank you.


****UPDATE****
Homework resubmitted as requested. Thank you.
